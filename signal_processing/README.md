# Signal Processing

This sub-directory concerns itself with the signal processing functionality. At present it is a suite of software based upon a python version of [e.divisive](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ecp/versions/3.1.0/topics/e.divisive) which is itself based on [this document](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.4933.pdf) for change point detection, and [Generalized ESD Test for Outliers
(gesd)](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35h3.htm) for outlier detection.
