The code for the command line tool is in __signal\_processing/change\_points.py__. Within this file each sub-command is implemented in a function called '\<subcommand\>\_command'. For example 'change-points mark' is implemented by the *mark_command* function. The command functions are concerned with processing the command line arguments from click and invoking the implementation in the __signal\_processing/commands__ directory. In most cases there is a one to one relationship between the 'change-points \<command name\>' and the python file that implemented it. So the *mark_command* function delegates to __signal\_processing/commands/mark.py__. Some notable exceptions are the *hide_command* which is essentially a synonym of mark with the processed\_type parameter set to hidden. The other case being the *list_command* function which is implemented in __signal\_processing/commands/list\_change\_points.py__ as `list` is a builtin in python and it is a bad idea to reuse a builtin name.

In addition, there is a click group implemented in a function  called 'cli'. This group processes common command line arguments for all the other commands (e.g. -u / --mongo-uri, -d / --debug , -l / --log-file, etc.) and creates a `CommandConfiguration` instance which is passed to each command.
