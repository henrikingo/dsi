# Input for bootstrap.py which prepares an environment to provision resources for local performance
# testing. The bootstrap phase takes as input a small number of parameters which describe the system
# to be created. Based on these bootstrap parameters, bootstrap.py will prepare a work directory
# that contains additional .yml configuration files, terraform related files, etc. As an example,
# based on the infrastructure_provisioning key, it will put into place the related
# infrastructure_provisioning.yml file:
#
#     cp $DSI_PATH/configurations/infrastructure_provisioning/infrastructure_provisioning.cluster_type.yml infrastructure_provisioning.yml
#
# Please consult the documentation for more information: http://bit.ly/2ufjQ0R

# QUICKSTART
#
# To run the DSI infrastructure, make a copy of this file, then edit the entries below for your use.
# Then, run:
#
#     $DSI_PATH/bin/bootstrap.py --directory work
#                                --bootstrap-file /path/to/your/copy/of/this/file
#
# This will make a new directory work, configured with everything you need to run the
# infrastructure.
#
# After successfully running bootstrap.py, you can execute the following commands to provision
# infrastructure, set up mongodb, and run test workloads:
#
#     cd work
#     source dsienv.sh
#     infrastructure_provisioning.py
#     workload_setup.py
#     mongodb_setup.py
#     test_control.py
#
# Update the fields below to reflect personal information and desired configuration parameters:


# OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED (See $DSI_PATH/configurations/defaults.yml for default values):

# Specify the type of infrastructure to be provisioned (single, replica, shard, longevity,
# initialsync-logkeeper, workload_client).
# See the .yml files located in $DSI_PATH/configurations/infrastructure_provisioning for more
# information about each configuration.
infrastructure_provisioning: single

# There's only one to choose here:
workload_setup: common

# Specify the mongodb configuration to test (standalone, single-replica, replica, replica-2node,
# shard, shard-longevity, initialsync-logkeeper, atlas).
# See the .yml files located in $DSI_PATH/configurations/mongodb_setup for more information about
# each configuration.
mongodb_setup: standalone

# Specify the set of tests to be run. See the .yml files located in
# $DSI_PATH/configurations/test_control for more information about each set of tests.
test_control: ycsb.short

# There's only one to choose here:
analysis: common


# The following will be copied into a file overrides.yml. This is a handy way to set any other
# config option you want. The below values will override what is set in the other files.
overrides:
  infrastructure_provisioning:
    tfvars:
      # Personal information (REQUIRED)
      # Specify the path to your SSH private key file for AWS, the name of the key in EC2, and your
      # @10gen.com username. This is necessary to connect to your provisioned infrastructure. For a full
      # description, see the Requirements section of the documentation: http://bit.ly/2ufjQ0R.
      ssh_key_file: ~/.ssh/NAME_OF_SSH_KEY  # SSH private keyfile to use with AWS (~/.ssh/USERNAME-dsikey if you're following the doc)
      ssh_key_name: NAME_OF_SSH_KEY  # The Name of the Key, as known in EC2 (USERNAME-dsikey if you're following the doc)

      tags:
        owner: your.username  # Your mongodb email address
        expire-on-delta: 24  # Set expire-on tag this many hours in the future. (Default is 2.)


  # Remaining config is OPTIONAL
  mongodb_setup:
    # The MongoDB binary to use.
    # Note: It's also allowed to upload your own binary. Set this to the empty string "" to do that.
    # mongodb_binary_archive: mongodb_binary_archive: https://s3.amazonaws.com/mciuploads/dsi/sys_perf_4.0_caa42a1f75a56c7643d0b68d3880444375ec42e3/caa42a1f75a56c7643d0b68d3880444375ec42e3/linux/mongodb-sys_perf_4.0_caa42a1f75a56c7643d0b68d3880444375ec42e3.tar.gz

    atlas:
      # When mongodb_setup = atlas, use this to select the atlas configuration to use.
      setup: M30-like

# DSI will search for terraform in your PATH. Terraform is required for deploying clusters into EC2.
# See http://bit.ly/2ufjQ0R to download the files.
# You can also provide the path to the terraform binary here. (The file, not the directory
# containing it.) This will take precedence over a terraform found in your PATH.
terraform: ~/path/to/terraform

# Specify if running DSI in production mode. Set by Evergreen.
production: false
