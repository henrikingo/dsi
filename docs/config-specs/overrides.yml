    # The expire-on-delta tag is the number of hours added to the current datetime and is used to
    # set the expire-on tag for the AWS reaper. After the changes from TIG-1128, the
    # infrastructure_provisioning*.yml files use a shorter expire-on-delta to avoid leaking
    # AWS instances for an extended period of time. Increasing the number of hours may be useful
    # while experimenting locally to avoid the AWS instances being torn down out from under you.
